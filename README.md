# Data Analytics Project – Power BI Dashboard

📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates data analysis and visualization using **Power BI**.  
The dataset (`.csv`) is cleaned, analyzed, and then represented through an interactive **Power BI Dashboard** (`.pbix`).  
The aim is to derive meaningful insights and present them in an easy-to-understand format.


⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** → Data visualization & dashboard creation  
- **Excel / CSV** → Data storage format  
- **Data Analytics Concepts** → Data cleaning, analysis, and visualization  

🚀 How to Use
1. Clone this repository.  
2. Open the `.csv` file to explore the dataset.  
3. Open the `.pbix` file in **Power BI Desktop** to view the interactive dashboard.  
   - You can apply filters, drill down into details, and modify visuals.  

📊 Insights & Highlights
- Data cleaning and preprocessing performed before loading into Power BI.  
- Key performance indicators (KPIs) highlighted using cards and visuals.  
- Interactive charts and graphs for better decision-making.  

📌 Future Scope
- Adding more datasets for comparison.  
- Automating data refresh in Power BI.  
- Extending the project to integrate with Python for advanced analytics.
